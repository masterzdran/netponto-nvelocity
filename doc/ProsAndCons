Pros:
	Limited set of functions forces you to code only view logic (good for separation of concerns)	
	Easy to learn template language
	Same syntax as Velocity (for Java), allowing view reuse among different platforms
	Reuse skills for people with Java experience

Cons:
	Interpreted
	Community seem very inactive. That forced Castle Project to fork NVelocity and work on improvements and bug fixes.


The Velocity User Guide is intended to help page designers and content providers get acquainted with Velocity and the syntax of its simple yet powerful scripting language, the Velocity Template Language (VTL). 

What is Velocity?
	Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits web page designers to reference methods defined in Java code. Web designers can work in parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating a well-designed site, and programmers can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or PHP.
